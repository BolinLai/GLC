# Getting Started with PySlowFast

This document provides a brief intro of launching jobs in GLC for training and testing. Before launching any job, make sure you have properly installed the GLC following the instruction in [README.md](README.md) and you have prepared the dataset following [DATASET.md](slowfast/datasets/DATASET.md) with the correct format.

## Train from Kinetics Pretrained Models

Here we can start with training a model by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python tools/run_net.py \
 --init_method tcp://localhost:9877 \
 --cfg configs/Egtea/MVIT_B_16x4_CONV.yaml \
 TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE 16 \
 TEST.BATCH_SIZE 128 \
 NUM_GPUS 4 \
 TRAIN.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH /path/to/pretrained/K400_MVIT_B_16x4_CONV.pyth \
 OUTPUT_DIR checkpoints/GLC
 DATA.PATH_PREFIX /path/to/Ego4D/clips.gaze
```

[//]: # (You may need to pass location of your dataset in the command line by adding `DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset`, or )

You can simply add

```
DATA:
  PATH_PREFIX: path_to_your_dataset
```
To the yaml configs file, then you do not need to pass it to the command line every time.


## Resume from an Existing Checkpoint

If your checkpoint is trained by PyTorch, then you can add the following line in the command line, or you can also add it in the YAML config:

```
TRAIN.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH path_to_your_PyTorch_checkpoint
```

## Perform Test
We have `TRAIN.ENABLE` and `TEST.ENABLE` to control whether training or testing is required for the current job. If only testing is preferred, you can set the `TRAIN.ENABLE` to False, and do not forget to pass the path to the model you want to test to `TEST.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH`.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4 python tools/run_net.py \
 --cfg configs/Ego4d/MVIT_B_16x4_CONV.yaml \
 TRAIN.ENABLE False \
 TEST.BATCH_SIZE 32 \
 NUM_GPUS 1 \
 OUTPUT_DIR checkpoints/GLC \
 TEST.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH /path/to/checkpoint \
 DATA.PATH_PREFIX /data/Ego4D/clips.gaze (set as your own path)
```

You can also set `DATA.PATH_PREFIX` in configs directly.
