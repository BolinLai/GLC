**[Update]** Please check out our latest work in ECCV 2024 about egocentric gaze forecasting -- ["Listen to Look into the Future: Audio-Visual Egocentric Gaze Anticipation"](https://bolinlai.github.io/CSTS-EgoGazeAnticipation/).

**[Update]** This work was accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

**[Update]** We won the Best Student Paper award of BMVC.

## Introduction

![avatar](demo/method.png)

## Installation

Please find installation instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). This repository is built based on [SlowFast](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast), so you can also refer to the instructions in [SlowFast Installation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/blob/main/INSTALL.md).
You may follow the instructions in [DATASET.md](slowfast/datasets/DATASET.md) to prepare the datasets. Pretrained models on Kinetics can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md) (The pretrained checkpoint is somehow unavailable. We also uploaded the pretrained MViT [weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cZjY9jK7urPxvZfYumIVVVvdXLmVsiJk/view?usp=drive_link) online).

## Quick Start

Follow the example in [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) to start training your own model.

## Pretrained Weights

We have released our pretrained GLC model with best performance on EGTEA and Ego4D. You can download via these links [[EGTEA weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15XVipU1CqoosyvPU1vfcG0w2LuLQecF1/view?usp=sharing) | [Ego4D weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zQdZuV4OowEJxBZAAWr_MuZcN7LJujOw/view?usp=sharing)].
